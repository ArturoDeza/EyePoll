# EyePoll
Poll EyeTracking Data from .ASC files

This Following script has written in MATLAB and should be able to parse information from EyeTrackers that output .EDF files (that can later be converted to .ASC, with EDF2ASC) file converters.

It should be able to output:
- Fixation Starting Position
- Fixation End/Landing Position
